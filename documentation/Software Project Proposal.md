### BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

1. Scope Creep: 
   - Risk: Client requests additional features or design changes.
   - Mitigation: Clearly define project scope in the contract. Any changes will be subject to change orders and additional costs.

2. Browser Compatibility Issues:
   - Risk: Unexpected compatibility issues with specific browsers may require additional development time.
   - Mitigation: Allocate a small contingency budget (5% of total, $79) for addressing unforeseen compatibility issues.

3. Client Feedback Delays:
   - Risk: Delayed client feedback could extend the project timeline.
   - Mitigation: Establish clear deadlines for client feedback in the project timeline. Delays may result in project extension fees.

4. Technology Changes:
   - Risk: Web standards or browser updates during development could impact the application.
   - Mitigation: Use stable, well-supported web technologies. Budget includes time for staying updated on any critical changes during the project.

5. Testing Environment Limitations:
   - Risk: Limited access to specific devices or browsers for testing.
   - Mitigation: Utilize browser emulation tools and online testing services. If specific device testing is required, additional costs may apply.

```

The critical path for this project consists of the following key activities:

1. Requirements Gathering: Ensuring all project requirements are clearly defined and understood.
2. Design Phase: Creating and approving the UI/UX design for the web application.
3. Development Phase: Implementing the core functionality of displaying "Hello World," today's date, and the refresh button.
4. Testing Phase: Thoroughly testing the application across different browsers and devices.
5. Deployment: Making the application live and accessible to users.
6. Project Handover: Finalizing documentation and closing the project.

These activities are crucial to keeping the project on schedule. Any delays in these tasks will directly impact the project's completion date. To mitigate risks:

- Prioritize clear communication with the client during requirements gathering and design approval.
- Allocate adequate time for development and testing to ensure quality.
- Prepare deployment environment in advance to avoid last-minute issues.
- Maintain detailed documentation throughout the project to facilitate smooth handover.
